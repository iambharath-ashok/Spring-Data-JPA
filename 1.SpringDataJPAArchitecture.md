#	Spring Data JPA Architecture


-	The DAO layer usually consists of a lot of boilerplate code that can and should be simplified
-	There are many advantages of simplification of Dao Layer

	-	 consistency of data access patterns and consistency of configuration

-	Spring Data takes this simplification one step forward and makes it possible to remove the DAO implementations entirely
-	The interface of the DAO is now the only artifact that we need to explicitly define
-	In order to start leveraging the Spring Data programming model with JPA, a DAO interface needs to extend the JPA specific Repository interface – JpaRepository
-	This will enable Spring Data to find this interface and automatically create an implementation for it


##	Custom Access Method and Queries

-	The DAO will already have some basic CRUD methods (and queries) defined and implemented
-	To define more specific access methods, Spring JPA supports quite a few options:

	-	simply define a new method in the interface
	-	provide the actual JPQ query by using the @Query annotation
	-	use the more advanced Specification and Querydsl support in Spring Data
	-	define custom queries via JPA Named Queries
	
	

##	Automatic Custom Queries

-	When Spring Data creates a new Repository implementation, it analyses all the methods defined by the interfaces 
	-	And tries to automatically generate queries from the method names
-	Let’s look at an example: if the entity has a name field (and the Java Bean standard getName and setName methods), 
	-	we’ll define the findByName method in the DAO interface; this will automatically generate the correct query
	
				public interface IFooDAO extends JpaRepository<Foo, Long> {
				   Foo findByName(String name);
				}
			
-	In case that the parser cannot match the property with the domain object field, we’ll see the following exception:


				java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No property nam found for type class org.rest.model.Foo
		

##	Manual Custom Queries

-	 custom query that we’ll define via the @Query annotation:
			
			
			@Query("SELECT f FROM Foo f WHERE LOWER(f.name) = LOWER(:name)")
			Foo retrieveByName(@Param("name") String name);


##	Transaction Configuration

-	The actual implementation of the Spring Data managed DAO is indeed hidden since we don’t work with it directly
-	More explicitly, this uses a read-only @Transactional annotation at the class level, which is then overridden for the non-read-only methods

##	 Exception Translation is Alive and Well


-	exception translation is still enabled by the use of the @Repository annotation on the DAO.
-	This annotation enables a Spring bean postprocessor to advise all @Repository beans with all the PersistenceExceptionTranslator instances found in the Container, and provide exception translation just as before


##	Spring Data Configuration

			@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.guru.bharath.jpa.dao")
			public class PersistenceConfig { ... }
			
			
			<jpa:repositories base-package="org.rest.dao.spring" />
	

##	The Maven Dependency
			
			<dependency>
			   <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
			   <artifactId>spring-data-jpa</artifactId>
			   <version>2.1.6.RELEASE</version>
			</dependency>	
			
##	Using Spring Boot


-	We can also use the Spring Boot Starter Data JPA dependency that will automatically configure the DataSource for us
-	We also need to make sure that the database we want to use is present in the classpath
-	In our example, we’ve added the H2 in-memory database:		


				
				<dependency>
				   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
				   <version>2.1.3.RELEASE</version>
				</dependency>
				<dependency>
					<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
					<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
					<version>1.4.197</version>
				</dependency>


-	That’s it, just by doing these dependencies, our application is up and running and we can use it for other database operations
-	No need to define datasource and entity manager beans, transaction manager beans
-	Spring Boot provides an easy way to do this using properties in the application.properties file:

				spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
				spring.datasource.username=sa
				spring.datasource.password=sa
